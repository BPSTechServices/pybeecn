    cli vs jupyter notebook
questions
    can you 'use' jupyter notebook from a cli?

Add csv parser? so you can give it population info about each neighborhood total pop and other race pop, and output a csv file in the form that I already have? Sounds achievable.

Pytests
    when running pytest for all pytest works.

    when trying to run it for individual files, there is an error saying pybeecn module does not exist. May be because of working in virtual environment mode for development. Try to create a 'make.py' file form scratch.
    Need to get individual pytests to work.

    Document structure of pytest. And associated files for test
    __init__.py files are required in each module from tests down.
        tests
            module --> test install
                submodule --> test .py files for submodule

    21 April:
        pytest passing but giving warnings. Moving on.


PROCESSES
Effective merge process:
    determine branch type (feature, improvement, etc)
    determine branch name (what will be done on it)
        create new branch
            push branch
            view on github remote
            create draft pull request
            create description of what is to be done on branch
        Add code to branch
            add code to tests
        verify pytests pass
            run pytest
                verify pytests pass
         push code to remote
         update pull request
            change from draft pull request
